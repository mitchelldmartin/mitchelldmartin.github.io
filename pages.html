            <h2>Origins</h2>
            <p>Basketball originated in December 1891 when Dr. James Naismith, a Canadian physical education instructor, invented the game at the International YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts. Seeking an indoor activity to keep his students active during the winter, Naismith designed a game with peach baskets and a soccer ball. The objective was to throw the ball into the opposing team's basket, suspended about 10 feet above the ground. Despite initial skepticism, the sport's popularity grew rapidly, spreading to colleges and institutions. The first professional league, the National Basketball Association (NBA), was formed in 1949 through the merger of the Basketball Association of America (BAA) and the National Basketball League (NBL). Today, basketball is a global phenomenon, played at various levels and enjoyed by millions worldwide.</p>
